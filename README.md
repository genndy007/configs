# Configuration files for Linux system
As for me, I like to change my Linux system frequently: to test new features, or just for the sake of interest. But my tools I use do not change, so every time I install a new system I need to tweak all tools I used. That's why I decided to make my life easier - by saving all those dotfiles and configs to one repository.
# My tools I use that need configs
  * Bash
  * Vim
  * Nano
  * Git
